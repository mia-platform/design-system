## Install

> :warning: At the moment, the package is published only internally in Mia-Platform. We will release it on public npm soon.

```bash
yarn add @mia-platform-internal/console-design-system-react
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import {Button} from '@mia-platform-internal/console-design-system-react'

const Example = () => {
  return (
    <Button />
  )
}
```

## Local Development

For local development, you can run:

```bash
yarn install # install all dependencies
```

Then, run Storybook:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

To run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Update the themes

The themes are generated from the `theme-generator.json` file exported from Figma and they are coupled in each of different folder in `src/themes/files/`.

If a `theme-generator.json` file is changed, it is required to regenerate the new theme lauching the command:

```bash
yarn update-themes
```

##Â Icons

Icons are shipped in the `@mia-platform-internal/console-design-system-react/icons` sub-package. The SVG components can be created and placed in the `/icons` directory running:

```bash
yarn build-icons
```

This command launches a script that copies a set of icon packs from the dist of the [react-icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons) dependency and build the set of Mia-Platform icons from the files contained in `/src/assets/icons`. To add a new icon you just need to place a new `.svg` file here (and don't forget to update the `/src/assets/icons/icons.stories.mdx` story file).

Given the high number of files, the script is pretty slow: Therefore, in CI it is run only on tags.

## License

All files under the src folder must have the license boilerplate attached to files. This is checked by CI.
To automate it, you can install [addlicense](https://github.com/google/addlicense) and run:

```sh
yarn addlicense
```
